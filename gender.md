> Gender seems to be a current 'hot-button' topic in the media,
but when I actually stopped and thought,
it turned out I didn't really know much about it, what it means, and exactly how it relates to other aspects of sexuality.
I've been trying to rectify this with a bit of research,
and below is a summary of my current understanding in order to open it up to critique and improvement.

## Thinking along a spectrum

Most real world measurements that we might choose to make about people are likely to fall along a continuous scale.
For example,
we wouldn't arbitrarily group people into classes of either *tall* or *short*,
instead we would directly measure their height.
Based on this we may then choose to use some rule to group them;
such as -- everyone over 1.8 m is *tall*, everyone below is *short*.
This may be a useful simplification,
but it is understood that underlying the simple *tall*/*short* binary categories we have set up there may be a range of different heights.
In fact the difference between a *tall person* and a *short person* may only be a few centimetres;
the 1.8 m threshold that we have used is completely arbitrary and would not be appropriate for all populations.

This idea that behind group labels there are one or more measurements made along a continuous spectrum is something that I think provides a useful frame for thinking about gender issues.
I'm a very visual thinker, so if we took <span class="figEm person">a hundred people</span> and marked their height on <span class="figEm scale">a scale</span> it might look something like this:

![One hundred heights along a scale](heightRug.svg)
^[{-} One hundred people's height marked as a dash on a scale]

To make this clearer we can stack them up on top of one another,
which makes <span class="figEm distribution">the distribution</span> more obvious;
there are lots of people grouped around an <span class="figEm average">average height</span>,
with fewer people who are <span class="figEm tall short">very tall or short</span>.

^[{-} One hundred people's height as a distribution]

Not all distributions will look like this though.
There is no reason they need to be symmetrical,
or for them to have a single peak.

## Sex

We could take our same hundred people and measure them in a few different ways.
The measurements that are most relevant to discussing the sex of the people are:

* their number and type of sex chromosomes;
* their sex hormones;
* their type of gonads -- ovaries or testicles;
* their reproductive anatomy including their internal and external genitalia.

^[{-} ![One hundred people's sex measured along different scales](sex.svg)

The XX or XY chromosomes inherited during reproduction are a primary determinant of biological sex.
<span class="figEm chromosomes">These are largely binary,
although there are some variations in these and in how they manifest during development</span>.

<span class="figEm hormones">Sex hormones,
androgens (including testosterone) and estrogens,
are produced by the body in varying quantities</span> and have a major impact on determining sex, particularly during development.

The reproductive anatomy of a person develops based on their chromosomes and hormones.
<span class="figEm genitalia">Its size and occurrence can vary significantly,
with a range of 'ambiguous' genitalia between the accepted norms of *male* and *female*</span>;
<span class="figEm quigley">the Quigley scale is a descriptive, visual system for grading this into seven classes</span>.

Although these separate aspects influence one another,
there is also substantial variation in the developmental process;
therefore it is necessary to measure each aspect independently as they will not necessarily correlate.
So if we consider individual people from our hundred then they may appear at a different point on each measurement scale.
Looking across all measurements it is then possible to separate our hundred people into two roughly equal size groups,
which we call <span class="figEm male">*male*</span> and <span class="figEm female">*female*</span>;
however there may be some people who don't fit neatly into either group,
either because they <span class="figEm intersexCentre">sit in the centre on several measures</span>,
or because they <span class="figEm intersexSplit">sit in the *male* category on some measures and in the *female* category for others</span>.
These people are referred to as <span class="figEm intersex">*intersex*</span> --
estimates are that between 0.05% and 1.7% of the population is born with intersex traits.

All of the above is based on biological differences,
and therefore the distinction between *male* and *female* is sometimes referred to as *biological sex*.
<span class="figEm assignedSex">At birth the sex of a child is typically assigned to it based on observation</span>.
Intersex babies may be assigned as *male* or *female*,
either incorrectly or arbitrarily;
they may also undergo surgery to 'correct' their sex.
Due to these practices the phrase *assigned sex* is also used.


## Gender identity

^[{-} ![How *assigned sex* relates to *gender identity*](genderIdentity.svg)
How *assigned sex* relates to *gender identity*]

In ordinary speech *sex* and *gender* are often used interchangeably,
and indeed this was the defined meaning until the 1960s.
More recently though, the term *gender* has been used to refer to social and psychological differences between people.

There is evidence that male and female brains can differ,
with variation in a number of neurological areas.
This leads to the possibility of a mismatch between brain and body.

*Gender identity* refers to the sex a person's brain tells them they are.
Most typically this <span class="figEm cis">psychological *identity* aligns with their *assigned sex* --
this is referred to as being *cisgender*
(or simply *cis*)</span>.
Where <span class="figEm trans"> *identity* does not align with *assigned sex* a person is *transgender* (or *trans*)</span>.
An assigned male person who identifies as female is referred to as a <span class="figEm transWoman">*trans woman*,
or *male-to-female* (MTF)</span>.
Conversely, someone assigned as female but who identifies as male is called a <span class="figEm transMan">*trans man*,
or *female-to-male* (FTM)</span>.
Some people don't feel either male or female,
which is often described as *non-binary*.
Such people may choose a label such as <span class="figEm queer">*genderqueer*, *gender variant*, or *gender fluid*</span>.

It is important to note that the term *identity* does not imply any personal choice in the matter.
The significant distress a person can experience as a result of their *sex* and *gender* not matching is called *gender dysphoria*;
this may be alleviated through choosing to change some aspect of their body.
The more specific term *transexual* may be preferred by some people.


## Gender role

^[{-} ![One hundred people's gender role measured along different scales](genderRoles.svg)
One hundred people's gender role measured along different scales]

Societal expectations have developed regarding how each sex is supposed to appear and act.
These are referred to as *gender roles*,
and include things like how a person dresses, communicates, behaves, or grooms themselves.
We could choose to assess each of our hundred people on a scale from *masculine* to *feminine* for each of these things
(assuming a common societal culture).
We would expect a distribution of results in all cases,
with an individual person appearing at different points on each scale.

We can think of a *gender role* as being an aggregation of all these social expectations typically assigned to a man or woman.
A person may conform strongly or weakly to all aspects of a <span class="figEm masculine">masculine</span> or <span class="figEm feminine">feminine</span> gender role,
they might be <span class="figEm ambiguousNonBinary">ambiguously between on some</span>,
or they could be <span class="figEm mixedNonBinary">masculine for some and feminine for others</span>.
The term <span class="figEm nonBinary">*gender non-conforming*</span> may be used to describe people in these latter two groups
(*androgynous* and *cross dressing* are also specific terms for atypical gender roles).

Although the typical *gender roles* are defined relative to *sex*,
i.e. *males* are typically *masculine* and *females* are typically *feminine*,
*gender expression* refers to how an individual person expresses themself,
which need not align in this way.

It is important to note that both *cis* and *trans* people may express themselves differently to their *gender identity*.
For example,
being a feminine cis male does not imply that they are (or should be) a trans woman.
Likewise,
it is totally possible to be a masculine trans woman.
In other words,
*gender expression* is separate from *gender identity*.


## Sexuality

It should be noted that all of the above makes no statement about a persons *sexual orientation*,
in that it only relates to a person's biology, how they feel about themself, and how they express themself.
A person of any sex and gender may be romantically or sexually attracted to another person of any sex or gender;
the nature of that attraction is referred to as their *orientation*.
Sexual orientation may be considered a continuum ranging from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.

^[{-} ![Sexual orientation](sexualOrientation.svg)
Different sexual orientations]

The most common case of <span class="figEm heteroMan">a man attracted to women</span>,
or <span class="figEm heteroWoman">a woman attracted to men</span>,
is referred to as <span class="figEm hetero">*heterosexuality*
(or being *straight*)</span>.
<span class="figEm homo">Same sex attraction is generally called *homosexuality*,
or being *gay*</span>,
with the specific term <span class="figEm lesbian">*lesbian* for women attracted to women</span>.
<span class="figEm bi">*Bisexuality* is romantic or sexual attraction to both men and women</span>.

Other descriptions that may be used include <span class="figEm pan">*pansexual*,
which rejects the the notion of binary genders</span>,
and *asexual*,
where there is a lack of sexual attraction to others of any sex.
The term *questioning* is also sometimes used to describe those who are unsure of their sexual orientation and do not wish to select a label.

Although sex and gender are often used interchangeably when discussing a person's orientation,
transgender people typically take the orientation label that corresponds with their own gender identity;
i.e. a trans woman who is solely attracted to women would identify as a lesbian.

## Wrap up

Although I had a sort of vague notion of most of the above before looking into it,
I don't think I could have properly separated out the terminology.

I think very visually,
so I put together the figures above to document the picture that I now have in my head.
Of course there are lots of other ways these issues could be drawn out,
but perhaps this view is useful to others?

## Disclaimers

* I'm not an expert.
* Science and language are continually evolving.
* Distributions are to demonstrate the concept only, they are not based on anything other than vague guesswork (actual data welcomed!).
* All diagrams should be considered simplifications.
For example, it is totally possible for a *non-binary* person to be *bisexual*, but the drawing gets quite messy.
