> Gender seems to be a current 'hot-button' topic in the media,
but when I actually stopped and thought about it,
it turned out I didn't really know much about gender, what it means, and how it relates to other aspects of sexuality.
I've been trying to rectify this with a bit of research,
and below is a summary of my current understanding in order to open it up to critique and improvement.

## Thinking along a spectrum

Most real world measurements that we might choose to make about people are likely to fall along a continuous scale.
For example, we don't immediately group people as either *tall* or *short*, we directly assess their height.
Based on this we may then choose to use some rule to group them;
such as -- everyone over 1.8 m is *tall*, everyone below is *short*.
This may be a useful simplification,
but everyone understands that underlying the simple *tall*/*short* binary categories we have set up there may be a range of different heights.
In fact the difference between a *tall person* and a *short person* may only be a few centimetres,
and the 1.8 m threshold that we have set up is actually quite arbitrary and would not be appropriate for all populations.

This idea that behind group labels there are one or more measurements made along a continuous spectrum is something that I think provides a useful frame for thinking about gender issues.
I'm a very visual thinker, so if we took <span class="figEm person">a hundred people</span> and marked their height on <span class="figEm scale">a scale</span> it might look something like this:

<figure>
^[{-} One hundred people's height marked as a dash on a scale]
![One hundred heights along a scale](heightRug.svg)
</figure>

To make this clearer we can stack them up on top of one another,
which makes <span class="figEm distribution">the distribution</span> more obvious;
there are lots of people grouped around an <span class="figEm average">average height</span>,
with less people who are <span class="figEm tall short">very tall or short</span>.

<figure>

</figure>

Not all distributions will look like this though.
There is no reason they need to be symmetrical,
or for them to have a single peak.

## Sex

We could take our same hundred people and measure them in a few different ways.
The measurements that are most relevant to discussing the sex of the people are:

* their number and type of sex chromosomes;
* their sex hormones;
* their type of gonads -- ovaries or testicles;
* their reproductive anatomy including their internal and external genitalia.

The XX or XY chromosomes inherited during reproduction are a primary determinant of biological sex.
<span class="figEm chromosomes">These are largely binary,
although are some variations in these and in how they manifest during development</span>.

<span class="figEm hormones">Sex hormones,
androgens (including testosterone) and estrogens,
are produced by the body in varying quantities</span> and have a major impact on determining sex, particularly during development.

The reproductive anatomy of a person develops based on their chromosomes and hormones.
<span class="figEm genitalia">Its size and occurrence can vary significantly,
with a range of 'ambiguous' genitalia between the accepted norms of *male* and *female*</span>;
<span class="figEm quigley">the Quigley scale is a descriptive, visual system for grading this into seven classes</span>.

<figure>
^[{-} One hundred people's sex measured along different scales]
![One hundred people's sex measured along different scales](sex.svg)
</figure>

Although these separate aspects influence one another,
there is also significant variation in the developmental process;
therefore it is necessary to measure each aspect independently as they will not necessarily correlate.
So if we consider individual people from our hundred then they may appear at a different point on each measurement scale.
Looking across all measurements then it is straightforward to separate our hundred people into two roughly equal size groups,
which we call <span class="figEm male">*male*</span> and <span class="figEm female">*female*</span>;
however there may be some people who don't fit neatly into either group,
either because they <span class="figEm intersexCentre">sit in the centre on several measures</span>,
or because they <span class="figEm intersexSplit">sit in the *male* category on some measures and in the *female* category for others</span>.
These people are referred to as <span class="figEm intersex">*intersex*</span> --
estimates are that between 0.05% and 1.7% of the population is born with intersex traits.

All of the above is based on biological differences,
and therefore the distinction between *male* and *female* is sometimes referred to as *biological sex*.
<span class="figEm assignedSex">At birth the sex of a child is typically assigned to it based on observation</span>.
Intersex babies may be assigned as *male* or *female*,
either incorrectly or arbitrarily;
they may also undergo surgery to 'correct' their sex.
Due to these practices the phrase *assigned sex* is often used.


## Gender role

In ordinary speech *sex* and *gender* are often used interchangeably,
and indeed this was the defined meaning until the 1960s.
More recently though, the term *gender* has been used to refer to social and psychological differences between people.

Societal expectations have developed based on sex around how people are supposed to appear and act.
These are referred to as *gender roles*,
and include things like how a person dresses, communicates, behaves, or grooms themselves.
We could choose to assess each of our hundred people on a scale from *masculine* to *feminine* for each of these things
(assuming a common societal culture).
We would expect a distribution of results in all cases,
with an individual person appearing at different points on each scale.

<figure>

![One hundred people's gender role measured along different scales](genderRoles.svg)
</figure>

We can think of a *gender role* as being an aggregation of all these social expectations typically assigned to a man or woman.
A person may conform strongly or weakly to all aspects of a <span class="figEm masculine">masculine</span> or <span class="figEm feminine">feminine</span> gender role,
they might be <span class="figEm ambiguousNonBinary">ambiguously between on some</span>,
or they could be <span class="figEm mixedNonBinary">masculine for some and feminine for others</span>.
The terms <span class="figEm nonBinary">*third gender*, *non-binary*, or *gender non-conforming*</span> may be used to describe people in these latter two groups
(*androgynous* and *cross dressing* are also specific terms for atypical gender roles).


## Gender identity

Although the typical *gender roles* are defined relative to *sex*,
i.e. *males* are *masculine* and *females* are *feminine*,
*gender identity* refers to how a person feels,
which may not necessarily align in this way.
The case where <span class="figEm cis">a persons psychological *gender identity* aligns with their *assigned sex* is referred to as *cisgender*
(or simply *cis*)</span>.

<figure>
^[{-} How *assigned sex* relates to *gender identity*]
![How *assigned sex* relates to *gender identity*](genderIdentity.svg)
</figure>

Where <span class="figEm trans">a person's *gender identity* does not align with their *assigned sex* they are *transgender* (or *trans*)</span>.
An assigned male person who identifies as female is referred to as a <span class="figEm transWoman">*trans woman*,
or *male-to-female* (MTF)</span>.
Conversely someone assigned as female but who identifies as male is called a <span class="figEm transMan">*trans man*,
or *female-to-male* (FTM)</span>.
People who <span class="figEm queer">feel neither male nor female may choose a label such as *genderqueer*, *gender variant*, or *gender fluid*</span>.

The significant distress a person can experience as a result of their *assigned sex* and *gender* not matching is called *gender dysphoria*.
This may be alleviated through choosing to change some aspect of their body.
The more specific term *transexual* may be preferred by some people.


## Sexuality

It should be noted that all of the above makes no statement about a persons *sexual orientation*,
in that it only relates to a persons biology and how they feel about themself.
A person of any sex and gender may be romantically or sexually attracted to a person of any sex or gender;
the nature of that attraction is referred to as their *orientation*.
Sexual orientation may be considered a continuum ranging from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.

^[{-} Different sexual orientations]

The most common case of <span class="figEm heteroMan">a man attracted to women</span>,
or <span class="figEm heteroWoman">a woman attracted to men</span>,
is referred to as <span class="figEm hetero">*heterosexuality*
(or being *straight*)</span>.
<span class="figEm homo">Same sex attraction is generally called *homosexuality*,
or being *gay*</span>,
with the specific term <span class="figEm lesbian">*lesbian* for women attracted to women</span>.
<span class="figEm bi">*Bisexuality* is romantic or sexual attraction to both men and women</span>.

Other descriptions that may be used include <span class="figEm pan">*pansexual*,
which rejects the the notion of binary genders</span>,
and *asexual*,
where there is a lack of sexual attraction to others of any sex.
The term *questioning* is also sometimes used to describe those who are unsure of their sexual orientation and do not wish to select a label.

Although sex and gender are often used interchangeably when discussing a persons orientation,
transgender people typically take the orientation label that corresponds with their gender identity;
i.e. a trans woman who is solely attracted to women would identify as a lesbian.

## Wrap up

Although I had a sort of vague notion of most of the above before looking into it,
I don't think I could have properly separated out the terminology.
I feel like I visualise a lot of issues along a sort of spectrum,
and so I put together the figures above document the picture that I have in my head.
Of course there are lots of other ways these issues could be drawn out,
but perhaps this view is useful to others?
