<p>Gender seems to be a current ‘hot-button’ topic in the media, but when I actually stopped and thought, it turned out I didn’t really know much about it, what it means, and exactly how it relates to other aspects of sexuality. I’ve been trying to rectify this with a bit of research, and below is a summary of my current understanding in order to open it up to critique and improvement.</p>

<section id="thinking-along-a-spectrum" class="level2">
<h2>Thinking along a spectrum</h2>
<p>Most real world measurements that we might choose to make about people are likely to fall along a continuous scale. For example, we wouldn’t arbitrarily group people into classes of either <em>tall</em> or <em>short</em>, instead we would directly measure their height. Based on this we may then choose to use some rule to group them; such as – everyone over 1.8 m is <em>tall</em>, everyone below is <em>short</em>. This may be a useful simplification, but it is understood that underlying the simple <em>tall</em>/<em>short</em> binary categories we have set up there may be a range of different heights. In fact the difference between a <em>tall person</em> and a <em>short person</em> may only be a few centimetres; the 1.8 m threshold that we have used is completely arbitrary and would not be appropriate for all populations.</p>
<p>This idea that behind group labels there are one or more measurements made along a continuous spectrum is something that I think provides a useful frame for thinking about gender issues. I’m a very visual thinker, so if we took <span class="figEm person">a hundred people</span> and marked their height on <span class="figEm scale">a scale</span> it might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="heightRug.svg" alt="One hundred heights along a scale" /> <span><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> One hundred people’s height marked as a dash on a scale<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>To make this clearer we can stack them up on top of one another, which makes <span class="figEm distribution">the distribution</span> more obvious; there are lots of people grouped around an <span class="figEm average">average height</span>, with fewer people who are <span class="figEm tall short">very tall or short</span>.</p>
<p><img src="heightDist.svg" alt="One hundred heights along a scale" /> <span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> One hundred people’s height as a distribution<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Not all distributions will look like this though. There is no reason they need to be symmetrical, or for them to have a single peak.</p>

<section id="sex" class="level2">
<h2>Sex</h2>
<p>We could take our same hundred people and measure them in a few different ways. The measurements that are most relevant to discussing the sex of the people are:</p>
<ul>
<li>their number and type of sex chromosomes;</li>
<li>their sex hormones;</li>
<li>their type of gonads – ovaries or testicles;</li>
<li>their reproductive anatomy including their internal and external genitalia.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> <img src="sex.svg" alt="One hundred people’s sex measured along different scales" /> One hundred people’s sex measured along different scales<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The XX or XY chromosomes inherited during reproduction are a primary determinant of biological sex. <span class="figEm chromosomes">These are largely binary, although there are some variations in these and in how they manifest during development</span>.</p>
<p><span class="figEm hormones">Sex hormones, androgens (including testosterone) and estrogens, are produced by the body in varying quantities</span> and have a major impact on determining sex, particularly during development.</p>
<p>The reproductive anatomy of a person develops based on their chromosomes and hormones. <span class="figEm genitalia">Its size and occurrence can vary significantly, with a range of ‘ambiguous’ genitalia between the accepted norms of <em>male</em> and <em>female</em></span>; <span class="figEm quigley">the Quigley scale is a descriptive, visual system for grading this into seven classes</span>.</p>
<p>Although these separate aspects influence one another, there is also substantial variation in the developmental process; therefore it is necessary to measure each aspect independently as they will not necessarily correlate. So if we consider individual people from our hundred then they may appear at a different point on each measurement scale. Looking across all measurements it is then possible to separate our hundred people into two roughly equal size groups, which we call <span class="figEm male"><em>male</em></span> and <span class="figEm female"><em>female</em></span>; however there may be some people who don’t fit neatly into either group, either because they <span class="figEm intersexCentre">sit in the centre on several measures</span>, or because they <span class="figEm intersexSplit">sit in the <em>male</em> category on some measures and in the <em>female</em> category for others</span>. These people are referred to as <span class="figEm intersex"><em>intersex</em></span> – estimates are that between 0.05% and 1.7% of the population is born with intersex traits.</p>
<p>All of the above is based on biological differences, and therefore the distinction between <em>male</em> and <em>female</em> is sometimes referred to as <em>biological sex</em>. <span class="figEm assignedSex">At birth the sex of a child is typically assigned to it based on observation</span>. Intersex babies may be assigned as <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>, either incorrectly or arbitrarily; they may also undergo surgery to ‘correct’ their sex. Due to these practices the phrase <em>assigned sex</em> is also used.</p>

<section id="gender-identity" class="level2">
<h2>Gender identity</h2>
<p><span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> <img src="genderIdentity.svg" alt="How assigned sex relates to gender identity" /> How <em>assigned sex</em> relates to <em>gender identity</em><br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>In ordinary speech <em>sex</em> and <em>gender</em> are often used interchangeably, and indeed this was the defined meaning until the 1960s. More recently though, the term <em>gender</em> has been used to refer to social and psychological differences between people.</p>
<p>There is evidence that male and female brains can differ, with variation in a number of neurological areas. This leads to the possibility of a mismatch between brain and body.</p>
<p><em>Gender identity</em> refers to the sex a person’s brain tells them they are. Most typically this <span class="figEm cis">psychological <em>identity</em> aligns with their <em>assigned sex</em> – this is referred to as being <em>cisgender</em> (or simply <em>cis</em>)</span>. Where <span class="figEm trans"> <em>identity</em> does not align with <em>assigned sex</em> a person is <em>transgender</em> (or <em>trans</em>)</span>. An assigned male person who identifies as female is referred to as a <span class="figEm transWoman"><em>trans woman</em>, or <em>male-to-female</em> (MTF)</span>. Conversely, someone assigned as female but who identifies as male is called a <span class="figEm transMan"><em>trans man</em>, or <em>female-to-male</em> (FTM)</span>. Some people don’t feel either male or female, which is often described as <em>non-binary</em>. Such people may choose a label such as <span class="figEm queer"><em>genderqueer</em>, <em>gender variant</em>, or <em>gender fluid</em></span>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the term <em>identity</em> does not imply any personal choice in the matter. The significant distress a person can experience as a result of their <em>sex</em> and <em>gender</em> not matching is called <em>gender dysphoria</em>; this may be alleviated through choosing to change some aspect of their body. The more specific term <em>transexual</em> may be preferred by some people.</p>

<section id="gender-role" class="level2">
<h2>Gender role</h2>
<p><span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> <img src="genderRoles.svg" alt="One hundred people’s gender role measured along different scales" /> One hundred people’s gender role measured along different scales<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Societal expectations have developed regarding how each sex is supposed to appear and act. These are referred to as <em>gender roles</em>, and include things like how a person dresses, communicates, behaves, or grooms themselves. We could choose to assess each of our hundred people on a scale from <em>masculine</em> to <em>feminine</em> for each of these things (assuming a common societal culture). We would expect a distribution of results in all cases, with an individual person appearing at different points on each scale.</p>
<p>We can think of a <em>gender role</em> as being an aggregation of all these social expectations typically assigned to a man or woman. A person may conform strongly or weakly to all aspects of a <span class="figEm masculine">masculine</span> or <span class="figEm feminine">feminine</span> gender role, they might be <span class="figEm ambiguousNonBinary">ambiguously between on some</span>, or they could be <span class="figEm mixedNonBinary">masculine for some and feminine for others</span>. The term <span class="figEm nonBinary"><em>gender non-conforming</em></span> may be used to describe people in these latter two groups (<em>androgynous</em> and <em>cross dressing</em> are also specific terms for atypical gender roles).</p>
<p>Although the typical <em>gender roles</em> are defined relative to <em>sex</em>, i.e. <em>males</em> are typically <em>masculine</em> and <em>females</em> are typically <em>feminine</em>, <em>gender expression</em> refers to how an individual person expresses themself, which need not align in this way.</p>
<p>It is important to note that both <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em> people may express themselves differently to their <em>gender identity</em>. For example, being a feminine cis male does not imply that they are (or should be) a trans woman. Likewise, it is totally possible to be a masculine trans woman. In other words, <em>gender expression</em> is separate from <em>gender identity</em>.</p>

<section id="sexuality" class="level2">
<h2>Sexuality</h2>
<p>It should be noted that all of the above makes no statement about a persons <em>sexual orientation</em>, in that it only relates to a person’s biology, how they feel about themself, and how they express themself. A person of any sex and gender may be romantically or sexually attracted to another person of any sex or gender; the nature of that attraction is referred to as their <em>orientation</em>. Sexual orientation may be considered a continuum ranging from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.</p>
<p><span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> <img src="sexualOrientation.svg" alt="Sexual orientation" /> Different sexual orientations<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The most common case of <span class="figEm heteroMan">a man attracted to women</span>, or <span class="figEm heteroWoman">a woman attracted to men</span>, is referred to as <span class="figEm hetero"><em>heterosexuality</em> (or being <em>straight</em>)</span>. <span class="figEm homo">Same sex attraction is generally called <em>homosexuality</em>, or being <em>gay</em></span>, with the specific term <span class="figEm lesbian"><em>lesbian</em> for women attracted to women</span>. <span class="figEm bi"><em>Bisexuality</em> is romantic or sexual attraction to both men and women</span>.</p>
<p>Other descriptions that may be used include <span class="figEm pan"><em>pansexual</em>, which rejects the the notion of binary genders</span>, and <em>asexual</em>, where there is a lack of sexual attraction to others of any sex. The term <em>questioning</em> is also sometimes used to describe those who are unsure of their sexual orientation and do not wish to select a label.</p>
<p>Although sex and gender are often used interchangeably when discussing a person’s orientation, transgender people typically take the orientation label that corresponds with their own gender identity; i.e. a trans woman who is solely attracted to women would identify as a lesbian.</p>

<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Although I had a sort of vague notion of most of the above before looking into it, I don’t think I could have properly separated out the terminology.</p>
<p>I think very visually, so I put together the figures above to document the picture that I now have in my head. Of course there are lots of other ways these issues could be drawn out, but perhaps this view is useful to others?</p>

<section id="disclaimers" class="level2">
<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m not an expert.</li>
<li>Science and language are continually evolving.</li>
<li>Distributions are to demonstrate the concept only, they are not based on anything other than vague guesswork (actual data welcomed!).</li>
<li>All diagrams should be considered simplifications. For example, it is totally possible for a <em>non-binary</em> person to be <em>bisexual</em>, but the drawing gets quite messy.</li>
